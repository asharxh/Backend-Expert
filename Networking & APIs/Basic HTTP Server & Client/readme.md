For this basic http server and client 

Used : Python , Socket

import socket

I used Socket Programming to Connect Server with Client to Recieve Request.
A socket in Python is an endpoint for sending or receiving data across a network using the socket API.
Socket programming in Python involves using sockets to establish communication between a server and clients over a network.

methods/functions for sockets()

socket(): Creates a new socket.
bind(): Associates the socket to a specific address and port.
listen(): Starts listening for incoming connections on the socket.
accept(): Accepts a connection from a client and returns a new socket for communication.
connect(): Establishes a connection to a remote server.
send(): Sends data through the socket.
recv(): Receives data from the socket.
close(): Closes the socket connection.

this is basic program to connect, if expanding then we can connect multiple client with server
